# Key=Value Parser 
## make editing variables friendlier for humans


I once worked with a program that required the input of over 60 variables to run. I kept making versions of this tool with the parameters harcoded in, but the the number of inputs kept changing every sprint, and i got tired of updating it. This little html-based tool works with whatever collection of key=values you throw at it. 

Paste a set of key values in the big input box and hit ***Make Easier*** and the tool populates a form that allows you to edit the variables as needed. As you type in your edited variables, the output box will reflect your changes as you go, politely reformatted back into ugly key=value blob. The ***Copy Output*** button saves you the energy of having to do another `Ctrl+C`.
