# Key=Value Parser 
## make editing variables friendlier for humans


I once worked with a program that required the input of over 60 variables to run. I kept making versions of this tool with the parameters harcoded in, but the the number of inputs kept changing every sprint, and i got tired of updating it. This little html-based tool works with whatever collection of key=values you throw at it. 

Paste whatever collection of key values you have in the big input box and the tool populates a form that allows you to edit the variables as needed, and copy the output at the bottom, politely reformatted back into ugly key=value blob.
